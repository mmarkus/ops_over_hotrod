Current hotrod specifications (and existing clients) do not support a set of features which are highly requested by Infinispan's community.
Namely:
- transactions over hotrod
- map/reduce and distributed executors over hotrod
- querying over hotrod

This small project adds a workaround to support running the above mentioned functionality over hotrod.
Currently, the only supported functionality is transactions over hotrod. Querying and map/reduce can also be build in a
similar fashion to transactions.

For running transactions over hotrod please refer to this document: https://github.com/mmarkus/ops_over_hotrod/wiki/Usage-guide
